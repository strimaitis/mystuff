Hey, what's up.  

This is my github, demonstrating projects from courses including Intro to Computer Graphics, Intro to Operating Systems, and Machine Organization and Programming. These projects include my programming experience in C, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.  I have previous course experience with Java and Lisp (which I lost from my introductory CS courses, will keep looking for older files!) and have experience with Unity/C# and XCode/Swift which I will be uploading later in the year.
